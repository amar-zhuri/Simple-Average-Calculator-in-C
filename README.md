# Simple Average Calculator in C

This C program calculates the average of a series of numbers entered by the user. It prompts the user to input the total count of numbers (n) followed by n integers. The program then computes the average and outputs it.

## Usage
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
gcc average_calculator.c -o average_calculator
2. Run the compiled executable:
./average_calculator
3. Enter the total count of numbers followed by the individual integers.

## Example
$ ./average_calculator
5
1
2
3
4
5
3.000000
3.000000

## Note
- This program calculates the average by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count (n).
- The result is displayed with double precision.
